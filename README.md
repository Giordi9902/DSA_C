# DSA in C

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository, created by Giorgio Di Fusco. This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms written in C.

## Features

- **Array**: Dynamic array implementation.
- **List**: Linked list implementation.
- **Stack**: Stack implementation using an array.
- **Queue**: Queue implementation using an array.
- **Tree**: Binary tree implementation.

## Building the Project

To build the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Compiler**: GCC or any C compiler
- **Make**: Make utility for building the project

### Build Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. **Build the Project**:

    Run the following command to compile the project:

    ```sh
    make
    ```

    This will compile all the source files and produce the executable.

3. **Running the Program**:

    After building, you can run the executable. The default executable is named `my_program` and can be executed with:

    ```sh
    ./bin/my_program
    ```

4. **Cleaning Up**:

    To remove the compiled files and clean the project, use:

    ```sh
    make clean
    ```
